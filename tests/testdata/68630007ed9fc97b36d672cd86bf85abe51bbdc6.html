 abstract = {The UNIX operating system, a general-purpose time-sharing system, has, without marketing, advertising, or technical support, become widely used by universities and scientific research establishments. It is the de facto standard of comparison for such systems and has spawned a small industry of suppliers of UNIX variants and look-alikes. This article attempts to uncover the reasons for its success and to draw some lessons for the future of operating systems.},
